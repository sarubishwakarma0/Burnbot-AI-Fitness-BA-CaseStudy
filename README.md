# BurnBot – AI-Powered Fitness App (Business Analyst Portfolio Case Study)

## Overview
BurnBot is a fitness app designed for busy professionals and goal-driven users who want an easier, smarter way to stay on track. Powered by artificial intelligence, the app blends smart workout tracking, nutrition analysis, wearable tech, and real-time motivation to improve health outcomes and user consistency.

This Business Analyst case study demonstrates the full project lifecycle from initial gap discovery to structured business and functional documentation.

## Problem Statement

BurnBot aims to solve this by introducing:
- AI-driven motivation and reminders
- Smart integration with wearable devices
- Real-time calorie recognition and tracking
- A personalized dashboard that evolves with user progress
